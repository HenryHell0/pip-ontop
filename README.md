# pip-ontop
A GNOME extension in Javascript to make Picutre-in-Picture windows be set to "always on top" automatically. 

- right now it only works for google chrome(maybe, havent tested
- it works on my machine ðŸ˜Ž
- made at like 3am so we'll see

if it doesent work feel free to like email me or something. It probably wont though. rn school just started so I'm busy busy!! I'd love to make this fully-featured, and add stuff like a GUI for customizing which windows are automatically always on top or something so you can fully customize. like a bonus window manager. ok bye
